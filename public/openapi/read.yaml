    # Overview

    The following document outlines every Read API route available via NodeBB. Unlike the write API, the v1.x API was coded organically, and is **not** strictly RESTful. These shortcomings will be addressed in time as the APIs mature.

    ## Shortcomings

    The Read API is named because its primary use is by NodeBB itself when navigating between pages. Therefore, the routes almost universally always follow the same path as actual pages on NodeBB itself. There are also a small number of non-`GET` routes, which doesn't necessarily make sense in a Read API. These will be merged into the Write API in time.

    ## Authentication

    There are a multitude of ways to authenticate with the Read API.

    ### Cookie Authentication

    This default authentication behaviour of this API is via cookie jar to find a valid session. A valid login session is required for API calls that pertain to operations involving a logged-in user. For example, `/api/unread` is a route showing unread topics, and is not accessible by guest users.

    ### Bearer Authentication

    Both the Read API and Write API offers bearer authentication, as administered through the administration panel.

      * For NodeBB v1.x, this is provided by [`nodebb-plugin-write-api`](https://github.com/NodeBB/nodebb-plugin-write-api). The Write API plugin needs to be installed before authentication via bearer token is enabled on routes provided by the Read API.
      * For NodeBB v2.x+ (in development), the Write API is available in core, and bearer authentication is available out-of-the-box

    ### JSON Web Token (JWT)

    The Write API also consumes valid JWTs as payload bodies, when signed with a server-generated key. The same restrictions apply as above, with Bearer Authentication (re: NodeBB v1.x vs v2.x).

        This route retrieve the list of categories currently available to the
        accessing user. It doesn't necessarily mean that the user can *enter*
        the category, as that is a separate privilege. Specifically, this route
        will return all categories that grant the calling user the "Find
        Category" privilege.


        Subcategories are also returned, nested under a category's `children` property.

      description: >-
        This particular shorthand is useful if you are looking to redirect to a user's profile (or other associated pages), but do not know or want to retrieve their userslug,
        which is part of the canonical url.

        For example, to go to `uid` 15's list of topics made, you can navigate to `/api/uid/15/topics`, which will send you to the appropriate canonical URL for that user's topics.
