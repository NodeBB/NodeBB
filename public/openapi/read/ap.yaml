  summary: Fetch URL for in-app processing
  description: |
    This route accepts a URL in the `resource` query parameter, and runs some quick tests to
    determine whether that address points to an ActivityPub resource. If so, then it will try
    to process it locally and redirect the user to the local representation of it.

    If there is no local representation available, then the user is sent off-site as originally
    expected.
