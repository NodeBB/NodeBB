// The above is not a great localization because one would usually
// write "2 days ago" in Finnish as "2 päivää sitten", however
// one would write "2 days into the future" as "2:n päivän päästä"
// which cannot be achieved with localization support this simple.
// This is because Finnish has word suffixes (attached directly
// to the end of the word). The word "day" is "päivä" in Finnish.
// As workaround, the above localizations will say
// "2 päivää tulevaisuudessa" which is understandable but
// not as fluent.
