# Important note about localising NodeBB

The files here are read-only and overwritten daily (if there are changes) by the
helper bot [Misty](https://github.com/nodebb-misty).

Our localisation efforts are handled via [our Transifex Project](https://explore.transifex.com/nodebb/nodebb/),
and any pull requests made to this directory will be automatically closed because
localisations can go out-of-sync when edited directly.

If there are non-localised strings and you cannot find them in Transifex, please
[open a new issue on our bug tracker](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB/issues/new)
so we can take a look.

Thank you for helping localise NodeBB!
