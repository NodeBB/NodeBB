## Test Execution Notes

The expanded test suite now provides comprehensive coverage of:

1. **All user-facing features** of the threading system
2. **Admin configuration** options
3. **Backward compatibility** with non-threaded posts
4. **Migration scenarios** from legacy systems
5. **Edge cases** including deleted posts, special characters, and performance
6. **Cross-browser compatibility** including mobile
7. **Accessibility requirements**
8. **Real-time collaborative** scenarios

The tests are designed to catch regressions and ensure the threading feature works reliably across all supported platforms while maintaining full backward compatibility.
